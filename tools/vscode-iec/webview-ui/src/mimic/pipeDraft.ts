/** Resolve a pipe-drawing draft into an addPipe payload, or null when
 * there isn't enough to complete a pipe yet.
 *
 * `draft` is every point placed by an explicit click so far; `draftFrom`/
 * `draftLastSnap` are the port anchors (if any) the first/most-recent click
 * landed on. `cursor` is the live rubber-band end and `hoverPort` the port,
 * if any, it is currently resting on.
 *
 * The live rubber-band segment is treated as an IMPLICIT final click —
 * mirroring what an actual click there would produce — in EITHER of two
 * cases:
 *
 *   1. The cursor is resting on a PORT the draft hasn't already ended on
 *      (`hoverPort` set, `draftLastSnap` null). The draw preview has been
 *      showing that connecting segment the whole time; dropping it on finish
 *      is the "Enter completes the pipe but not TO the port" bug — the pipe
 *      lands short of the port the user was clearly aiming at. This holds
 *      even when the clicked draft ALREADY meets the floor (e.g. a bent
 *      pipe: click port A, click a corner, then Enter over port B), which is
 *      exactly the case the old `!floorMet`-only guard silently dropped.
 *
 *   2. The clicked draft alone doesn't yet meet the anchor-aware floor
 *      (minInteriorPoints) — the rubber-band point is needed to form a pipe
 *      at all (e.g. one click plus Enter over its far end).
 *
 * A cursor merely DRIFTING over empty canvas on an already-complete draft is
 * still ignored (case-1 needs a port, case-2 needs an unmet floor), so an
 * ordinary multi-click floating pipe finishes exactly as clicked. */
